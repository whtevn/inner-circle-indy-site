            <p>
            Many of the foods that we have become accustomed to originate with cuisines from around the world. Often the original was born from necessity, availability, tradition, or cultural knowledge and beliefs. We want to bring these things back into our lives, and appreciate the meals that we have come to love by gaining more understanding of where they came from.</p>
            <p>
            At Inner Circle we strive to bring quality, hand-made convenience items to the local produce market, while also paying tribute to the culinary traditions that have been the cause and inspiration of modern food in all varieties. We hope to help you bring fresh ingredients of all types into your kitchen, and an extra dimension of made from scratch cooking into your meals.
